Here we are building a 3D scene of a french restaurant. At each step, we are not adding more than 8 assets in total into the scene. 

First, we place the most important assets (e.g. furnitures, bigger objects) and use those as our anchors. Here is a list of them:
* Tables : 1 
* Chairs : 4
* Bar : 1
* Bar stools : 2
