Here's a description of a person's dream:

I'm in adult form and there I am going to band class, and then a concert. It's rush time people are rushing to go to "our" band concert, my bandmates. I think I play the clarinet just like I did in real life in junior high. I don't see the intsrument much. I go into a building I don't know how I got in that isn't shown in the dream. I find the girls dressing room and there are other girls in there getting dressed, but it's very blurry I just see figures moving fast. I'm the one that's late because there's a band concert tonight and we all have to play in it. While in the dressing room I wanted to do my hair and put on my outfit. Then I went somewhere it was like a pause in the dream. I then get this feeling and see everyone is GONE and dressed they're already in the "ballroom" getting ready to play for the audience. So when I noticed people are gone and I'm the one that's late the dream turns into a maze. I try to find my way to the concert room where everyone else is, and have a hard time finding, and then I do. It then begins, I made it and I'm there playing a little bit with the rest of the pack. I also felt like I didn't know how to play my instrument for a moment, and had anxiety about that, I played on anyway. The concert was short so I oddly don't see our band playing much.

Here's a list of the unique locations where this dream took place, each described using a phrase (visual appearance, style...etc):
* A messy band room
* Girls dressing room 
* An unknown, intimidating building
* Glamorous ballroom
