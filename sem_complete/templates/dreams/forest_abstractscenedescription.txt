Here's a fragment of a dream:

The forest is unsettling, with strange creatures that I have never seen before. Some of them even talk. As we wander, we come across an ancient tree, with a gaping hole at its base. Inside the hole is an owl.

In a simple phrase, a description of the environment/setting in the fragment would be:

Mysterious forest.
